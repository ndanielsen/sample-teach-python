## Purpose

Have you been curious about writing code? Have you tried to get started but just couldn't get things to work? Have you heard that python is a great language to learn but not sure where to start? These workshops got you covered.  

In these workshops, we will:
- Get you set up for success and continued learning afterwards
- Introduce basic python syntax including variables, data types, functions and for-loops
- Demonstrate common operations for cleaning and parsing data

Each workshop will review some basic elements of the python programming language and will deep dive into a particular useful data type or common operation. It will conclude with a real world type exercises and homework to will apply the materials covered in the workshop.

A high emphasis is placed on working with other students to debug and troubleshoot your code. It's the best way to learn!

## Why It's Great to Learn Python

:snake: It's free. You can download it for free, there are ways to learn it for free, and there's a whole range of packages available for free.

:snake: It's easy. Other languages make you remember strange commands or keep track of curly braces everywhere. Not so with Python. That makes it a great beginner programing language.

:snake: It's everywhere. It's a powerful language that is used by a wide variety of companies and organizations to solve all sorts of problems.

:snake: It's community-focused. Python exists solely because of volunteers and has a great community both online and off that connects people.
